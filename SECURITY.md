# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since this is all experimental there is no security guideline. I'll simply bump the Version if necessary.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Pleas open a bug report as soon as you find a security problem, I'll try to fix as soon as possible. 

Of course I'd be more than happy if you send my a pull request with a fix as well :-)
