> A deamon for tracking FS20 dimmer commands to mqtt following the [mqtt-smarthome](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome) architecure.

Based on the idea of [mqtt-smarthome](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome) and especially on the work of hobbyquaker [hm2mqtt.js](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/hm2mqtt.js).

This deamon tries to behave as ELV FS20 dimmer actuators do. Actually it's not 100% accurate, so it won't work to guess the dimlevel all the time.

The idea was to us FS20 wall switches etc. to control other (non-FS20) dimmers light lightify or hue lamps. In my case I use openhab2 to control the lamps based on the output of this module.

Please read the --help output for commandline options. I tried to stick as close as possible to hm2mqtt.js.

## Install

`sudo npm install -g fs20dimmer2mqtt`

As hobbyquaker I also suggest to use pm2 to manage the fs20dimmer2mqtt process (start on system boot, manage log files, ...). There is a really good howto at the [mqtt-smarthome repo](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome/blob/master/howtos/homematic.md)

### Examples

* Simple Example, local mqtt server, no auth, np retain, watchdog on:
`/usr/bin/fs20dimmer2mqtt -c telnet --cul-host 192.168.4.30 -r -w 90`
starts the deamon, connects to cuno via telnet at `192.168.4.30` and publishes at `fs20dimmer/status/#` of the local mqtt (port 1883)

* Complex Example, local mqtt server, with auth:
`/usr/bin/helios2mqtt -c telnet --cul-host  192.168.4.30 --cul-port 23 -m mqtt://192.168.4.10 -u f20dimmerMqtt -p seCRe7 -s -v warn -r -w 90 --fs20-map /home/smarthome/fs20-map.json`
starts the deamon, connects to cuno via telnet at `192.168.4.30` with poert 23 and publishes at `fs20dimmer/status/#` of the mqtt server at `192.168.4.10` using the credentials above. Published will be json strings with additional infos. Will only print warning and errors. Uses a map fs20 devices to name using the definition in home of smarthome user.

### mqtt topics

* `fs20dimmer/status/xxx`:
fs20dimmer2mqtt pushes the current dimlevel of each received FS20 device to either fs20dimmer/status/deviceNameFromMApFile or to fs20dimmer/status/FS20/123400 if device does not have a map file. You can choose using -s Option if you would like to simply have the value or a json string with more info like timestamp and explanation.

* `fs20dimmer/get/xxx`:
fs20dimmer2mqtt listens to get requests here. You can request status updates for specific devices here. The response will be published as status.

* `fs20dimmer/connected`:
    * `0` means not connected (using a mqtt will, so this means deamon is not running at all or is not able to connect to mqtt server)
    * `1` means connected to mqtt but no connection to cul
    * `2` means connected to both, mqtt and cul

* `fs20dimmer/set/xxx`:
Can be used for changing the dim level and sending the FS20 command. The published value has to be: on, off or a level in percent [0-100].

### watchdog feature

The watchdog monitors mqtt-publish activity of fs20dimmer2mqtt. I suggest using at least 60 seconds. You can turn this on in order to let fs20dimmer2mqtt exit as a last measure if all reconnect attempts fail (i.e. twice the watchdog time went by without any successful publish. Reasons could for exmaple be a problem with modbus connection to helios and no data from cul or a connection problem to mqtt server. Use witch care - you have to make sure the process gets restarted after it exits, e.g. using pm2 or similar.
